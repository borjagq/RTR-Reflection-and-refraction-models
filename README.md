# Real-time Reflection and Refraction Models

A visualisation and comparison of different reflection and refraction models in OpenGL using reflection and refraction boxes.

## About this repo

This repository provides a way to visualize and compare various reflection and refraction models in OpenGL using reflection and refraction boxes. It's not just about exploring separate shaders; you can also make on-the-fly changes to shader settings in real-time. This showcases how these adjustments affect the rendered scene.
